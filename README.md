# vxcomponents

A vue framework based on vite and supports web components out of the box

Taobao NPM service is temporarily out of order, use https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/repository/npm/ instead.

Config file is vite.config.ts,
check it before doing any thing.

This framework aim to bring web component (aka custom-element) into real world usage. To achive this, we need to help developers CREATE, DEBUG, BUILD, DEPLOY and USE their WCs (web components) easily.

dev steps:

1. npm install (or yarn)
2. npm run dev (or yarn dev)
3. open browser, and navigate to https://localhost:3000/test.html
